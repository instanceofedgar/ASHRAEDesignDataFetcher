# ASHRAE Design Data Fetcher

This project provides a simple interface for fetching ASHRAE design data for heating and cooling based on geographical coordinates using the ASHRAE Meteo API.

## Features

- Retrieve ASHRAE meteo station data based on latitude and longitude.
- Obtain ASHRAE design data for heating and cooling (specifically, heating design temperature at 99.6% and cooling design temperature at 0.4%).
- Handle errors with custom exception classes.

## USE

To test this project use the notebook file ashrae_design_data.ipynb
ASHRAE_VERSION.v2021 is the only available version
